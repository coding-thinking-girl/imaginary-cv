        <p>
          I am a girl of three passions, robotics, violin, and golf.
          I have won various prizes, all over the world, in each of these activities.
          I am also the Founder and Director of TechTap,
          a company that you probaby all know which sells robots all over the world,
          to make your everyday life beautiful.
          I love working on challenging projects with my team.
          It teached me and still teaches me, a great part of my knowledge.
          As everyone says, "two heads are better than one."
          Whatever you are doing in life right now,
          never give up. Work until you have reached the very top,
          and you will be rewarded.
          People might tell you that you're uncapable, but don't give up, do your best,
          and your dreams will come true.
